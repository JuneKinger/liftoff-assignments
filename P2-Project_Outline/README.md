## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am more than halfway done with my Doggy Daycare project. I have a dog whom I love, and I thought it would 
be fun to develop a doggy daycare project. Owners can register their pets at Dogs Always! doggy daycare so
that their pets can have a great playtime with other dogs, as well as having their dogs have fun in a 
canine pool.

### Features
User login: Owners can sign up and login/logout. Each user will have a profile page with a drop-down 
feature for editing and deleting their profiles.

Dog Details: Owners can register their dogs (one or more) with edit and delete dog details features.

Schedule an Appointment: Owners can schedule appointments for their dogs at "Dogs Always! Doggy daycare" 
with a delete option for deleting the appointments they created.

Pricing: Owners can find out about pricing and how much it would cost (one or more dogs) for boarding one
or more dogs.

Administration: Set up a way for admin to see the day's or the week's appointments for the dogs that would
come into the daycare.

Blog (possible later inclusion): I also plan to add a blog feature with possible dog videos where people 
can blog about their dogs and watch informative and funny dog videos.

Vet details: I may also include (if I have time) a vet story where people can add their vet names, address,
 and phone numbers with a search option to find vets, as well as rate their vets for other owners to check out.
